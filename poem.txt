Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world is a #$#$# so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.

When the blazing sun is gone to #$#$#,
When he nothing shines upon,
Then you show your little light,
Twinkle, twinkle, all the #$#$#

u r a very #$#$# and #$#$# guy which has very #$#$# skills
